## Introduction

The rules that determine [what gets attention](/what-deserves-our-attention) in social platforms are often referred to as "algorithms". But algorithms are only part of the story. Another way of understanding social platforms is as **social protocols** that a community uses to decide where to allocate its collective attention.

Like parliamentary procedure or the rules of a courtroom, social protocols shape the conversation: they determine what topics are discussed and which voices are heard, and what ideas and information spreads.

Understanding these protocols can help us explain some of the phenomenon we see in social networks, such as filter bubbles, polarization, and misinformation. And it can indicate ways that social protocols could be engineered to promote healthier outcomes.

## Echo Chambers are Social Protocols

Consider a social media "echo chamber", centered around a popular user on ùïè or Bluesky. Whenever the user posts something, he starts a conversation among his followers.

This user and his followers have strong opinions. When somebody replies to his posts in a way that challenges his worldview, the followers will dog-pile the offender, overwhelming them with critical or even abusive responses. If they don't withdraw from the conversation, they get blocked, while the most obsequious defenders of the orthodoxy might get retweeted and attract new followers.

A very simplified view of this situation is that a *social protocol* has emerged that a group of like-minded people use for enforcing the worldview of that echo chamber.

## News Aggregator are Social Protocols

Another example of a social protocol is the news aggregator. Hacker News uses upvotes to determine which stories rank highest on the front page, along with moderator-enforced rules for keeping stories mostly on-topic. Since stories at the top of front page receive the most attention, the result is a protocol for focusing the community's attention and conversation on certain topics. 

Th Hacker News community also has its own informal rules about the kinds of stories and comments that tend to get upvoted. But the upvote-only system doesn't make it so easy for the community to strictly enforce a single narrow worldview. 

## Email is a Social Protocol

Email is yet another social protocol. The basic protocol is simple: you send an email, I periodically check my inbox and read emails when the sender and subject seem relevant. There are also some informal conventions: checking email too infrequently violates protocol, so to speak. So does using email for frequent short messages that would be better sent via SMS or a chat app.

## Formal + Informal Rules

Indeed any online communication platform has a corresponding social protocol.

The social protocol can be seen as a combination of **formal** rules enforced by the platform's software and moderation policies, and **informal** rules enforced by the users. 

The formal rules may not prevent users from disagreeing with the orthodoxy of an echo chamber, or posting stories that are not popular with the Hacker News crowd, or using email instead of messenger apps for frequent short messages. But they do make it possible for these informal rules to arise and be  enforced by users. 

And most importantly, the formal rules influence what *kinds* of informal rules tend arise, and thus the kinds of content that tends to be encouraged. Some rules encourage echo chambers and misinformation, others encourage SPAM and personal abuse.

## Engineering Social Protocols

But is it possible for the rules to encourage more positive outcomes?

Is it possible for a social protocol to encourage more intelligent and informed conversation? Or the sharing of accurate and unbiased news? Or honest product reviews? Can a social protocol be designed to *decrease* polarization?

Social-protocols.org is researching algorithms that use a combination of ideas from game theory, reputation systems, and bias-correction algorithms such as that used by [Community Notes](https://jonathanwarden.com/understanding-community-notes) to [bridge divides](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/bridging-based-ranking), [give truth the advantage](/give-truth-the-advantage), and increase [human alignment](/human-alignment-technology/).


## Conclusion

When we choose to use any online discussion platform we are choosing to participate in the protocol. We agree to contribute a certain amount of our attention to a feed or inbox or front page, and may choose to contribute content or vote or interact in other ways. The algorithm then uses this feedback to determine what content receives the attention of other users. And from the interaction of the algorithms and human behavior, a social protocol emerges: a set of formal rules informal conventions that focuses and shapes the group conversation.

When people voluntarily come together in an online community, they have the opportunity to decide what social protocols govern how the group allocates their attention. Why not deliberately choose social protocols that promote the kinds of outcomes we want for our communities.

## Analyzing Incentives



All algorithms can be "gamed" by people seeking attention. People game email, SMS, and phone calls with SPAM. They game Hacker News with voting rings. The social media game is even more complex, but one of the main "games" is playing ideological enforcer in an an echo chamber, attracting like-minded followers and crowding out dissent.

Analyzing the incentives produced by an algorithm, and the resulting game dynamics, can help us understand why social platforms amplify misinformation,  polarization, and abuse. 


## Engineering Outcomes

To what extent can the formal rules of a social protocol be intentionally designed to encourage healthier outcomes?


Rather than passively design platfroms based on short-term objectives such as maximizing profit.

## Example Social Protocol: Hacker News

Other online communities use different social protocols to allocate their collective attention. Hacker news uses upvotes to determine which stories rank highest on the front page. And by convention users focus most of their attention on the front page. So "read the front page and upvote stories you like" is roughly the social protocol the community uses to allocate its collective attention on discussions on topics of mutual interest.

## Other Social Protocols


Is this a good social protocol? Is this really the process we want choose for allocating our collective attention?




## Formal Protocols

Formal social protocols are used to discuss important decisions, in cases where who gets to speak and what gets to be said are crucial, such as in parliaments and courtrooms. But even casual conversations are constrained by informal social protocols, such as not interrupting, not talking for too long, or simply being polite.

But for online conversations, the formal rules of the protocol -- the algorithms -- are always in play. They are necessary because online communication is fundamentally different: online conversations are not groups of people together in a room, all more or less participating in the same conversation. They are potentially millions each in their own room but all talking at once, dropping in and out of the conversation. And the algorithms decide what parts of the overall conversation each person is exposed to.

## The Effect of the Algorithms

The formal protocol for determining who and what gets attention influence the *informal* rules and expectations for user behavior that emerge.

Consider a social media "echo chamber", centered around a popular user on ùïè or Bluesky. Whenever he posts something, he starts a conversation among his followers in the replies to the post. He can also "block" people so they can't participate in that conversation. That's the formal part of the protocol.

This user also has some strong opinions. When somebody disagree with him, his followers tend to dogpile the dissident, overwhelming him with critical or even abusive responses. If the dissident persists, they get blocked, while the most obsequious defenders of the orthodoxy might get retweeted and attract new followers. The dynamic is self-reinforcing. That's the informal part of the protocol.

## Other Social Protocols

Other online communities use different attention-allocation protocols. Hacker news uses upvotes to determine which stories rank highest on the front page. And by convention users focus most of their attention on the front page. So "read the front page and upvote stories you like" is roughly the social protocol the community uses to allocate its collective attention on discussions on topics of mutual interest.

Other social protocols include:
- Community Notes a protocol that uses [bridging algorithms](/understanding-community-notes) for allocating attention to *notes* -- additional context shown with posts. 
- Email is a social protocol comprising formal rules (SMTP), informal rules (SPAM filters) and mutual expectations about if and how often people read emails. 
- A *phone call* is a social protocol where expectations continue to evolve about if and when people answer phone calls.

There is also a reputation/karma system that gives further influence to users who have contributed more to the community in the past.

But online social protocols work very differently from social protocols in the physical world. First, in the physical world, group conversations are *synchronous*: a group of people might sit together in a room, with rules determining about who can speak, and for how long, and what they are allowed to say. Typically, only one person speaks at a time, and the attention of the entire group is (usually) directed to the single speaker.

In contrast, online discussions are often *asynchronous*: anyone can "speak" at any time. But there is no guarantee anyone will pay any attention to them. However, there are rules that influence who and what gets attention: algorithms determine the ranking and visibility of posts, and moderation rules can strictly limit what is said. 



Hacker News is a website for discussing topics related to technology, science, and startups. The protocol that determines what topics are discussed is not too complicated: users submit links to "stories", and there is a formula that determine how these stories are ranked on the front page. The ranking formula incorporates the number of upvotes from other users, as well as input from moderators working for Hacker News. 

This protocol focuses the attention of a large, knowledgeable intellectually-curious community on few dozen front-page stories each day, resulting in deep, substantive, thoughtful conversations about topics highly interesting to this community.

Discourse.org is another discussion platform intentionally designed to promote constructive, civil . Twitter/X's community notes is another social protocol...more deeply integrated into Twitter's protocol for public conversation. 

On top of the formal rules of the protocol, informal *conventions* have emerged. Users pay most attention to stories on the top of the front page -- a natural convention but not an inevitable consequence of the formal rules. Moderators have developed, in addition to their published guidelines, informal conventions about what kind of stories promote "substantive, thoughtful conversation driven by intellectual curiosity", and users have their own ideas about this. 

The protocol works well, though it does rely heavily on the skill and consistency of moderators. Many successful communities on Reddit are also heavily dependent on good moderation. Other platforms, such as discourse.org, attempt to be less dependent on individual moderators by building community-driving moderation tools into the protocol.

Other social protocols have not produced such wholesome results. Algorithms that optimize for engagement tend to amplify misinformed, abusive, and controversial posts (because they provoke reactions, which the algorithms interpret as engagement). Other protocols tend to promote division of communities into like-minded echo chambers.
