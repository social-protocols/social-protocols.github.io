## Introduction

The rules that determine [what gets attention](/what-deserves-our-attention) on social platforms are often called "algorithms," but algorithms are only part of the story. Another way to understand social platforms is as **social protocols**, or sets of formal and informal rules that communities use to allocate their collective attention.

Like parliamentary procedure or courtroom rules, social protocols shape conversations: they determine what topics are discussed and which voices are heard. Understanding these protocols can help explain phenomena we see in social networks‚Äîlike filter bubbles, polarization, and misinformation‚Äîand suggest ways social protocols could be engineered to promote healthier outcomes.

## Echo Chambers as Social Protocols

Consider a social media "echo chamber" centered around a popular user on ùïè or Bluesky. When this influential user posts, they initiate a conversation among their followers.

This user and their followers hold strong opinions. When someone challenges their worldview, the followers overwhelm the critic with harsh or even abusive responses. If the critic doesn't withdraw, they're blocked, while those who most aggressively defend the orthodoxy might be retweeted and rewarded with new followers.

This simplified example illustrates how a particular set of informal rules -- a *social protocol* -- can emerge organically within a like-minded community to enforce its worldview, driven and enabled by platform rules.

## News Aggregators as Social Protocols

Another example of a social protocol is the news aggregator. Hacker News, for instance, uses formal rules -- upvotes and moderator enforcement -- to determine which stories appear at the top of the front page. Because top-ranked stories naturally receive the most attention, this combination of formal rules and informal community preferences focuses collective attention on specific topics, reinforcing certain interests and norms within the Hacker News community.

## Email as a Social Protocol

Email is also a social protocol, mixing formal rules with informal etiquette. The basic formal rule is simple: you send an email, and I periodically check my inbox, reading emails based on sender and subject relevance. Informal conventions add nuance: checking email too infrequently or using email for frequent, short interactions (better suited to SMS or chat) violates these unspoken norms.

## Formal vs. Informal Rules

Indeed, any online communication platform embodies a social protocol composed of two distinct but interconnected components:

- **Formal rules**, enforced explicitly by software and moderation policies.
- **Informal rules**, enforced implicitly through user behavior and social expectations.

Formal rules can't explicitly enforce a political ideology or email etiquette, but they strongly influence which informal norms emerge. For example, Twitter's blocking feature tends to support formation of echo chambers. Other platforms have engagement-optimization algorithms that tend to amplify controversial or abusive content.

## Engineering Social Protocols

But is it possible for platform designers to encourage more positive outcomes through thoughtful protocol design? Can social protocols intentionally foster more intelligent and informed conversations, promote unbiased and accurate news, or decrease polarization?

Social-protocols.org is exploring algorithms that blend ideas from game theory, reputation systems, and bias-correction methods‚Äîlike those used by [Community Notes](https://jonathanwarden.com/understanding-community-notes)‚Äîto [bridge divides](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/bridging-based-ranking), [give truth the advantage](/give-truth-the-advantage), and improve [human alignment](/human-alignment-technology/).


## Conclusion

When we choose to engage with an online discussion platform, we participate in its underlying social protocol. We agree to allocate a portion of our attention to a feed, inbox, or front page, possibly contributing content, votes, or interactions. Platform algorithms use our feedback to determine which content reaches other users. This interplay between formal algorithms and informal human behavior forms a social protocol: a dynamic set of explicit rules and implicit conventions shaping collective conversations.

As individuals voluntarily join online communities, they collectively have the opportunity to actively choose or influence the social protocols that govern attention allocation. By deliberately selecting and designing these protocols, communities can better achieve the outcomes they truly desire.

## Analyzing Incentives



All algorithms can be "gamed" by people seeking attention. People game email, SMS, and phone calls with SPAM. They game Hacker News with voting rings. The social media game is even more complex, but one of the main "games" is playing ideological enforcer in an an echo chamber, attracting like-minded followers and crowding out dissent.

Analyzing the incentives produced by an algorithm, and the resulting game dynamics, can help us understand why social platforms amplify misinformation,  polarization, and abuse. 


## Engineering Outcomes

## Example Social Protocol: Hacker News

Other online communities use different social protocols to allocate their collective attention. Hacker news uses upvotes to determine which stories rank highest on the front page. And by convention users focus most of their attention on the front page. So "read the front page and upvote stories you like" is roughly the social protocol the community uses to allocate its collective attention on discussions on topics of mutual interest.

## Other Social Protocols


Is this a good social protocol? Is this really the process we want choose for allocating our collective attention?




## Formal Protocols

Formal social protocols are used to discuss important decisions, in cases where who gets to speak and what gets to be said are crucial, such as in parliaments and courtrooms. But even casual conversations are constrained by informal social protocols, such as not interrupting, not talking for too long, or simply being polite.

But for online conversations, the formal rules of the protocol -- the algorithms -- are always in play. They are necessary because online communication is fundamentally different: online conversations are not groups of people together in a room, all more or less participating in the same conversation. They are potentially millions each in their own room but all talking at once, dropping in and out of the conversation. And the algorithms decide what parts of the overall conversation each person is exposed to.

## The Effect of the Algorithms

The formal protocol for determining who and what gets attention influence the *informal* rules and expectations for user behavior that emerge.

Consider a social media "echo chamber", centered around a popular user on ùïè or Bluesky. Whenever he posts something, he starts a conversation among his followers in the replies to the post. He can also "block" people so they can't participate in that conversation. That's the formal part of the protocol.

This user also has some strong opinions. When somebody disagree with him, his followers tend to dogpile the dissident, overwhelming him with critical or even abusive responses. If the dissident persists, they get blocked, while the most obsequious defenders of the orthodoxy might get retweeted and attract new followers. The dynamic is self-reinforcing. That's the informal part of the protocol.

## Other Social Protocols

Other online communities use different attention-allocation protocols. Hacker news uses upvotes to determine which stories rank highest on the front page. And by convention users focus most of their attention on the front page. So "read the front page and upvote stories you like" is roughly the social protocol the community uses to allocate its collective attention on discussions on topics of mutual interest.

Other social protocols include:
- Community Notes a protocol that uses [bridging algorithms](/understanding-community-notes) for allocating attention to *notes* -- additional context shown with posts. 
- Email is a social protocol comprising formal rules (SMTP), informal rules (SPAM filters) and mutual expectations about if and how often people read emails. 
- A *phone call* is a social protocol where expectations continue to evolve about if and when people answer phone calls.

There is also a reputation/karma system that gives further influence to users who have contributed more to the community in the past.

But online social protocols work very differently from social protocols in the physical world. First, in the physical world, group conversations are *synchronous*: a group of people might sit together in a room, with rules determining about who can speak, and for how long, and what they are allowed to say. Typically, only one person speaks at a time, and the attention of the entire group is (usually) directed to the single speaker.

In contrast, online discussions are often *asynchronous*: anyone can "speak" at any time. But there is no guarantee anyone will pay any attention to them. However, there are rules that influence who and what gets attention: algorithms determine the ranking and visibility of posts, and moderation rules can strictly limit what is said. 



Hacker News is a website for discussing topics related to technology, science, and startups. The protocol that determines what topics are discussed is not too complicated: users submit links to "stories", and there is a formula that determine how these stories are ranked on the front page. The ranking formula incorporates the number of upvotes from other users, as well as input from moderators working for Hacker News. 

This protocol focuses the attention of a large, knowledgeable intellectually-curious community on few dozen front-page stories each day, resulting in deep, substantive, thoughtful conversations about topics highly interesting to this community.

Discourse.org is another discussion platform intentionally designed to promote constructive, civil . Twitter/X's community notes is another social protocol...more deeply integrated into Twitter's protocol for public conversation. 

On top of the formal rules of the protocol, informal *conventions* have emerged. Users pay most attention to stories on the top of the front page -- a natural convention but not an inevitable consequence of the formal rules. Moderators have developed, in addition to their published guidelines, informal conventions about what kind of stories promote "substantive, thoughtful conversation driven by intellectual curiosity", and users have their own ideas about this. 

The protocol works well, though it does rely heavily on the skill and consistency of moderators. Many successful communities on Reddit are also heavily dependent on good moderation. Other platforms, such as discourse.org, attempt to be less dependent on individual moderators by building community-driving moderation tools into the protocol.

Other social protocols have not produced such wholesome results. Algorithms that optimize for engagement tend to amplify misinformed, abusive, and controversial posts (because they provoke reactions, which the algorithms interpret as engagement). Other protocols tend to promote division of communities into like-minded echo chambers.
