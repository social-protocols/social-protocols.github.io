The rules that determine [what gets attention](/what-deserves-our-attention) in social platforms are often referred to as "algorithms". But algorithms are only part of the story. In social platforms, the amount of attention something receives is actually determined by **social protocols** that emerge from the interaction of formal rules such as algorithms with informal social conventions.

Like the protocols of a legislative body or the procedures of a court, these protocols shape the quality of discourse in online communities by influencing what topics are discussed and what arguments are heard.

But online social protocols work differently from offline protocols. In the physical world, a group of people might sit together in a room, with rules determining about who can speak, and for how long, and what they are allowed to say. Typically, only one person speaks at a time, and the **attention** of the entire group is (usually) directed to the single speaker.

In most online discussion platforms, anyone can "speak" at any time. But there is no guarantee anyone will pay any attention to them. However, there are still rules that influence what gets attention. The algorithms determine the ranking and visibility of posts, and moderation rules can strictly limit what is said. Combined, these rules have tremendous influence on what content gets attention. And these formal rules influence the *informal* conventions and expectations that emerge to comprise the overall social protocol.

The rules of offline social protocols are typically designed to drive productive discussion in pursuit of some desirable social outcome such as good legislation, a fair decision, or intelligent debate. Online social protocols are often designed much less intentionally; yet platforms have come to recognize the importance of healthy online discourse to the long-term success of an online community. Most invest heavily in moderation to remove the most toxic and abusive content, and many are increasingly recognizing the potential of the algorithms themselves to promote more informed and less divisive discourse.

Hacker News is an example of a social protocol that has had long-term success. The protocol is not too complicated: users submit links to "stories", and there are rules that determine how these stories are ranked on the front page. The ranking formula incorporates the number of upvotes from other users, as well as input from moderators working for Hacker News.

On top of the formal rules of the protocol, informal *conventions* have emerged. Users pay most attention to stories on the top of the front page -- a natural convention but not an inevitable consequence of the formal rules. Moderators have developed, in addition to their published guidelines, informal conventions about what kind of stories promote "substantive, thoughtful conversation driven by intellectual curiosity", and users have their own ideas about this. 

The protocol works well, though it does rely heavily on the skill and consistency of moderators. Many successful communities on Reddit also deteriorate apart when good moderators leave. Other platforms, such as discourse.org, attempt to be more robust and less depenendant on individual moderators by building community-driving moderation tools into the protocol.

Other social protocols have not produced such wholesome results. Algorithms that optimize for engagement indirectly amplifying misinformed, abusive, and controversial posts (because they provoke reactions, which the algorithms interpret as engagement). Other protocols tend to promote division of communities into like-minded echo chambers.

But better understanding of these dynamics, plus tools from math and game theory, are pointing the way towards new algorithms that [bridge divides], [give truth the advantage], are more transparent, and less dependent on moderators, 

When we choose to use any online discussion platform we are choosing to participate in the protocol. We agree to contribute a certain amount of our attention as we scroll through our feeds or scan our inboxes. We may also actively participate by submitting content or voting. The algorithm then uses this feedback to determine what content receives the attention of other users. And a social protocol emerges: a set of formal rules informal conventions that focuses and shapes the group conversation.

When people voluntarily come together in an online community, they have the opportunity to decide what social protocols govern how the group allocates their attention. Unfortunately, communities usually default to the practical choices offered by the large, free platforms. But they don't have to. We can deliberately build better social protocols that promote the kinds of outcomes we want for our communities.
