The rules that determine [what gets attention](/what-deserves-our-attention) in social platforms are often referred to as "algorithms". But algorithms are only part of the story. In social platforms, the amount of attention something receives is actually determined by **social protocols** that emerge from the interaction of formal rules such as algorithms with informal social conventions.

Like the protocols of a legislative body or the procedures of a court, these protocols shape the discourse in online communities. But online social protocols work differently from offline protocols. In the physical world, group conversations are *synchronous*: a group of people might sit together in a room, with rules determining about who can speak, and for how long, and what they are allowed to say. Typically, only one person speaks at a time, and the attention of the entire group is (usually) directed to the single speaker.

In contrast, online discussions are often *asynchronous*: anyone can "speak" at any time. But there is no guarantee anyone will pay any attention to them. However, there are rules that influence who and what gets attention: algorithms determine the ranking and visibility of posts, and moderation rules can strictly limit what is said. 

These rules have a tremendous impact on the conversation: they influence what topics are discussed, which "voices" are the loudest, and what information spreads. They influence perceptions about what ideas are popular and what people are influential. And these formal influence the emergence of *informal* conventions and expectations. It is the combination of rules, formal and informal, that we call a social protocol.

The rules of offline social protocols are typically designed to drive productive discussion in pursuit of some desirable social outcome such as good legislation, a fair decision, or intelligent debate. Online social protocols are often designed much less intentionally, yet there are examples of online social protocols that produce great results.

Hacker News is a website for discussing topics related to technology, science, and startups. The protocol that determines what topics are discussed is not too complicated: users submit links to "stories", and there is a formula that determine how these stories are ranked on the front page. The ranking formula incorporates the number of upvotes from other users, as well as input from moderators working for Hacker News. 

This protocol focuses the attention of a large, knowledgeable intellectually-curious community on few dozen front-page stories each day, resulting in deep, substantive, thoughtful conversations about topics highly interesting to this community.

Discourse.org is another discussion platform intentionally designed to promote constructive, civil . Twitter/X's community notes is another social protocol...more deeply integrated into Twitter's protocol for public conversation. 

<!--
On top of the formal rules of the protocol, informal *conventions* have emerged. Users pay most attention to stories on the top of the front page -- a natural convention but not an inevitable consequence of the formal rules. Moderators have developed, in addition to their published guidelines, informal conventions about what kind of stories promote "substantive, thoughtful conversation driven by intellectual curiosity", and users have their own ideas about this. 

The protocol works well, though it does rely heavily on the skill and consistency of moderators. Many successful communities on Reddit are also heavily dependent on good moderation. Other platforms, such as discourse.org, attempt to be less dependent on individual moderators by building community-driving moderation tools into the protocol.

Other social protocols have not produced such wholesome results. Algorithms that optimize for engagement tend to amplify misinformed, abusive, and controversial posts (because they provoke reactions, which the algorithms interpret as engagement). Other protocols tend to promote division of communities into like-minded echo chambers.

the dynamics that produce different outcome....

But better understanding of these dynamics, using concepts fro game theory, cybernetics, (and other fields), are pointing the way towards new algorithms that [bridge divides], [give truth the advantage], are more transparent, and less dependent on moderators, 


When we choose to use any online discussion platform we are choosing to participate in the protocol. We agree to contribute a certain amount of our attention as we scroll through our feeds or scan our inboxes. We may also actively participate by submitting content or voting. The algorithm then uses this feedback to determine what content receives the attention of other users. And a social protocol emerges: a set of formal rules informal conventions that focuses and shapes the group conversation.

When people voluntarily come together in an online community, they have the opportunity to decide what social protocols govern how the group allocates their attention. Unfortunately, communities usually default to the practical choices offered by the large, free platforms. But they don't have to. We can deliberately build better social protocols that promote the kinds of outcomes we want for our communities.
