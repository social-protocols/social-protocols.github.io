*The goal of Social Protocols is to enhance collective intelligence. We are working on open algorithms and protocols that benefit large scale human interaction.*

Join our [Zulip Chat](https://social-protocols.zulipchat.com/join/3awvls77dbmolwlradnfmkig/) and don't hesitate to ask any questions or present your ideas.
You can support our work on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/social-protocols).

## Active Projects

### Global Brain Algorithm

We are creating a [comment ranking algorithm](https://github.com/social-protocols/GlobalBrain.jl) to fight misinformation.

### Quality News

[**Quality News**](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a Hacker News client
that provides additional data and insights on Hacker News submissions, notably,
the **upvoteRate** metric. The **upvoteRate** is designed to better reflect the
intent of the community as revealed by their upvote behavior. We believe this
calculation can be a key component in the design of social protocols. See the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/social-protocols/quality-news#readme) for details.
