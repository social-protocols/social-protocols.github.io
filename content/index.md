*The goal of Social Protocols is to enhance collective intelligence. We are working on open algorithms and protocols that benefit large scale human interaction.*

Join our [Zulip Chat](https://social-protocols.zulipchat.com/join/3awvls77dbmolwlradnfmkig/) and don't hesitate to ask any questions or present your ideas.
You can support our work on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/social-protocols).


## Global Brain Algorithm

We are creating a [comment ranking algorithm](https://github.com/social-protocols/GlobalBrain.jl) to fight misinformation.
The core principle is to identify comments that have the **highest impact** on the vote streams on other posts and rank them accordingly.

<!-- We are in the process of creating a social media platform based on what we've learned -->
<!-- from our experiments during the past years: -->
<!-- ([Jabble](https://github.com/social-protocols/social-network)) based on our [Global Brain Algorithm](https://social-protocols.org/global-brain), which -->
<!-- converts a social media platform into a distributed brain, resulting in a whole that is -->
<!-- more intelligent than the individual human parts. -->

## Quality News

[**Quality News**](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a Hacker News client
that provides additional data and insights on Hacker News submissions, notably,
the **upvoteRate** metric. The **upvoteRate** is designed to better reflect the
intent of the community as revealed by their upvote behavior. We believe this
calculation can be a key component in the design of social protocols. See the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme) for details.

<!-- ## Propolis (2023) -->

<!-- [**Propolis**](https://github.com/social-protocols/propolis), inspired by -->
<!-- [Polis](https://pol.is), is an attempt to create a scaling collective -->
<!-- intelligence system based on asking and answering yes-no questions. -->
<!-- Propolis was archived because it was superseded by **Jabble**. -->
