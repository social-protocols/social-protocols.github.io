A = climate change is real
B = Donald Trump cheated on his taxes

prior majority of people think Trump cheated on his taxes, and also climate change is real (130)
if less people thought Trump cheated on his taxes, would that cause them to change their mind on climate change?


No. So unless we see a causal effect of B on A, we conclude it did not change minds. So the causal effect of C on A is limited by the magnitude of the causal effect of B on A. 

Let's say there is a small causal effect of B, increasing votes by 10. That 10 vote increase came from among the 80 that thought B=1. If the number of people think B=1 is cut in half, that increase would be cut in half? So if B=1 reduced from 140 to 70, increase cut from 10 to 5.  Let's say B=-1 is 230 and B=1 = 10, all 10 of which vote A=1. So the 10 increase in A is all due to the 10 that voted B=1. If we increase B=1 by half, that increase would be cut from 10 to 5.




	|     |Z=-1| Z=1 | SUM

	| Y=-1| 60 | 60  | 120   
	| Y=1 | 50 | 70  | 120
	| SUM | 110|130

P(Y=1|Z=-1) = 50/110 = .455 
P(Y=1|Z=1) = 70/130 = .538

P(Z=1|not sB) = 130/240 = .5417
P(Z=1|sB) = 140/240 = .583

P(Y=1|sB) = P(Y=1|Z=1)*P(Z=1|sB) + P(Y=1|Z=-1)*P(Z=-1|sB)

		.538 * .583 + .455 * (1 - .583) = .5033

		now if we reduce P(Z=1) to 140/240 = .5416

		.538 * .583 + .455 * (1 - .583) = .5033

		.538 * .5416 + .455 * (1 - .5416) = .4999


That's why we have to look at probability of A before W (sB). Let's say support for A was 150, until B "the IPC admits they faked the whole thing". So it changed 20 minds
