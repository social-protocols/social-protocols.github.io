# 2024-04-09: Feedback on "Deliberative Consensus Protocol"

Link: https://social-protocols.org/deliberative-consensus-protocols/

## Introduction: Scalable Group Decision-Making

>However, there are solutions to all these problems!

That sounds like too enticing of a promise too early on in the essay. If I'm an "uninitiated" reader, this might turn me away.


## Correcting for Ignorance using Deliberation

>informed honesty vs. dishonest conformity

This is really compelling! Great way to put it!


## Summary

**Third sentence**

>"But a deliberative consensus protocol can enhanced online group decision-making"

-> "can enhance"


**Last sentence**

>"This can help to filter misinformation, curb abusive behavior (that people cannot honestly endorse), and promote more deep and intelligent conversations."

That sentence at the end of the essay feels like it's making a new claim which may raise readers' skepticism. This might not be a good place to leave the reader in. I think the sentence can just be omitted, the paragraph works perfectly without it.
