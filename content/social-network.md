We are in the process of creating a social network based on what we've learned from our experiments during the past years.
The core of our concepts is a suite of novel algorithms that distribute attention over content.
Unlike most social networking platforms, we do **not** optimize for engagement.

As of right now, we haven't launched the platform yet.
However, we are developing in the open.

You can follow our progress on [Github](https://github.com/social-protocols/Y).

We are also trying to document our ideas in a comprehensive way.
If you are interested in the concepts behind our algorithms, visit [our documentation](https://social-protocols.org/y-docs/).
Be aware, though, that this document changes all the time and is (and will be for a while) incomplete.

If you want to be among the first to join, subscribe to our newsletter.
We won't bother you with regular marketing mails.
Instead, we will send out a notification when we reached an important milestone.
