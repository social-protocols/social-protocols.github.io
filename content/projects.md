## The Social Network of the Future

We are in the process of creating a social network based on what we've learned
from our experiments during the past years:
[The Social Network of the Future](https://social-protocols.org/social-network/)
([Github](https://github.com/social-protocols/social-network)) The core of our
concepts is the
[Global Brain Algorithm](https://social-protocols.org/global-brain), which
converts a social network into a distributed brain, resulting in a whole that is
more intelligent than the individual human parts.

## Quality News

[**Quality News**](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a Hacker News client
that provides additional data and insights on Hacker News submissions, notably,
the **upvoteRate** metric. The **upvoteRate** is designed to better reflect the
intent of the community as revealed by their upvote behavior. We believe this
calculation can be a key component in the design of social protocols. See the
[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme) for details.
