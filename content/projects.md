Here are some of our projects.

### Quality News

[**Quality News**](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on Hacker News submissions, notably, the **upvoteRate** metric. The **upvoteRate** is designed to better reflect the intent of the community as revealed by their upvote behavior. We believe this calculation can be a key component in the design of social protocols. See the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme) for details.


### Propolis

Inspired by [pol.is](https://pol.is/home), [**Propolis**](https://propolis.fly.dev/) enables useful discussions among thousands of people. See the [readme on Github](https://github.com/social-protocols/propolis).
