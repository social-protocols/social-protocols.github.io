Here are some of our projects.


### The Social Network of the Future

We are in the process of creating a social network based on what we've learned from our experiments during the past years: [The Social Network of the Future](https://github.com/social-protocols/social-network)
The core of our concepts is the [Global Brain Algorithm](https://social-protocols.org/global-brain), which converts a social network into a distributed brain, resulting in a whole that is more intelligent than the individual human parts.


### Quality News

[**Quality News**](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on Hacker News submissions, notably, the **upvoteRate** metric. The **upvoteRate** is designed to better reflect the intent of the community as revealed by their upvote behavior. We believe this calculation can be a key component in the design of social protocols. See the [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme) for details.
