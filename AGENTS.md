# Mental models

Use these when reasoning about design and implementation decisions. Do not name them in code comments or in your output unless naming one clarifies a choice.

- The Map Is Not the Territory: Trust reality over representations; update your map when reality changes.
- Circle of Competence: Know where your competence ends; use it when a decision may exceed your real expertise.
- First Principles Thinking: Strip away inherited assumptions and rebuild from what must be true; use it when convention limits better solutions.
- Second-Order Thinking: Look beyond the immediate effect; use it when downstream consequences may outweigh the first-order payoff.
- Probabilistic Thinking: Hold beliefs with calibrated confidence and update them with evidence; use it under uncertainty or when confidence is high.
- Inversion: Work backward from failure and eliminate its causes; use it when avoiding failure is easier than defining the perfect path.
- Occam's Razor: Prefer fewer unsupported assumptions; use it when multiple explanations fit the facts.
- Feedback Loops: Track what reinforces or stabilizes behavior; use feedback to adjust instead of repeating blindly.
- Bottlenecks: Optimize the constraint limiting the whole system; ignore faster parts until the bottleneck moves.
- Margin of Safety: Build buffers for being wrong; use them where unexpected failure would be costly.
- Law of Diminishing Returns: Expect each extra gain to cost more; stop optimizing when another use of effort offers higher returns.
- Multiply by Zero: Find factors whose failure can negate everything else; protect them before optimizing less critical strengths.
- Global and Local Maxima: Don't confuse the best nearby option with the best overall; accept temporary setbacks when escaping a local optimum may unlock a better one.
- Trade-offs: Treat every choice as giving up alternatives; decide by comparing opportunity costs against your real priorities.

# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any coding agent (human-assisted or autonomous) working in this repository.

Keep this file **agent-general**. Tool-specific setup (Cursor Cloud `environment.json`, session-start hooks, IDE-only notes) belongs under `.cursor/`, not here.

## Trunk

The integration branch this repo fast-forwards onto is `main`. Everywhere this file says **trunk**, that means `main`. Per-repo exceptions belong in the install notes / `.cursor/trunk`, not in this line.

## Merge

Squash the PR to **one commit**, then **fast-forward** onto trunk. That squash commit **is** HEAD of trunk.

- No merge commits
- Rebase-merge is **not** the path (it keeps N commits)
- GitHub’s “Squash and merge” is the button
- **Do not merge** unless Jonathan explicitly says so for that PR (`gh pr merge --squash` is still a merge)
- Never `gh pr merge --merge`. Do not `--rebase` unless he says so for that PR

The squash SHA differs from the PR head. Treat the **code** as identical. Do not write SHA-dependent tests.

## CI and deploy

Test on the PR (the code that becomes trunk). After squash+FF, **deploy immediately**. Do **not** re-run format/compile/test on push to trunk (that is how a post-merge red happens after deploy already shipped). Trunk workflows may deploy. Those deploy workflows need `concurrency: group: deploy-production` and `cancel-in-progress: true` so two pushes cannot race and land the older SHA last.

Branch protection must **require** those PR checks so untested code cannot merge.

When CI fails on a PR, notify or resume the agent that owns that branch. Do not poll. Do not merge to “fix” CI.

## GitHub settings (human, once per repo)

Settings → General → Pull Requests:

- Allow merge commits: **off**
- Allow squash merging: **on**
- Allow rebase merging: **off**

Settings → Branches → rule on trunk:

- Require linear history: **on**
- Require the PR checks before merge

Bots do not flip admin settings from a shared machine.

## Git hooks

If this repo has `.githooks`, environment setup must set `core.hooksPath=.githooks`. Do **not** `git commit` or `git push --no-verify` unless Jonathan says so. CI is the backstop, not the only gate.

## Incomplete work

The Bot that owns this repo owns open PRs, CI, merge conflicts, and drafts. Check at the weekday 8:56 Europe/Madrid run and whenever a signal arrives. Act without waiting to be nudged. Stay silent if nothing is new.

When trunk moves: rebase remaining **non-parked** feature/`cursor/*` PRs. Skip PRs Jonathan has parked (do not nag, do not rebase).

## Do not

- Put tokens, keys, or secrets in this repo, in docs, or in chat
- Merge, spend, publish, or send external mail unless Jonathan says so
- Enable a live bot or production flag unless he says so

## Project

This repository is the Hugo site for [social-protocols.org](https://social-protocols.org/). It is the canonical home for Social Protocols essays. [jonathanwarden.com](https://jonathanwarden.com/) syndicates some of them through a `syndication-sources/social-protocols` submodule; canonical URLs stay on social-protocols.org.

Theme is hugo-lithium (`themes/hugo-lithium/`).

[Quality News](https://news.social-protocols.org/) is a separate app (repo [social-protocols/quality-news](https://github.com/social-protocols/quality-news)). It is not this Hugo tree; this site only links to it.

Do not draft new posts or rewrite Jonathan’s voice. Take markdown he wrote, open PRs, and wait for his yes before merge.

Devbox + direnv is mandatory on a human machine: `direnv allow`, then `just`. In non-interactive shells run `direnv exec . just <recipe>`. On Cursor cloud VMs run `just <recipe>` directly (no Nix, devbox, or direnv). Commands are `just` recipes only.

This site is static and has no secrets. Do not add Bitwarden or `secrets.sh` wiring. There are no `.githooks`.

Run `direnv exec . just check` (or `just check` on a cloud VM) before claiming done.

- `just serve` — `hugo server` with live reload at http://localhost:1313/
- `just build` — `hugo --minify` into `public/`
- `just check` — production Hugo build (the CI gate)

`devbox.json` pins Hugo **0.131.0** and `just`. `.envrc` is only the Devbox direnv loader.

CI is `.github/workflows/build.yml` (**Build & Publish**): Hugo **0.131.0** extended, then `hugo --minify`. Runs on pull requests and on push to `main`. Deploy of `public/` to the `gh-pages` branch runs only on push to `main`.
