Users are then asked to respond to the poll assuming, or given, that the top sub-factcheck is true.</p><p>So for example, suppose an opinion poll asks <em>Will you vote for Joe Biden in 2024</em>? Initially 45% of users answer yes.</p><p>But then the next day Biden drops out of the race, and somebody posts a sub-factcheck &ldquo;Biden dropped out of the race&rdquo;. It gets a 99% accuracy estimate and is the top sub-factcheck.</p><p>The poll page now ask &ldquo;Assuming it is true that Biden dropped out of the race&mldr;will you vote for Joe Biden in 2024.&rdquo; Now, only 5% of users answer yes. So that&rsquo;s the informed/final result.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot illustrating what this might look like:</p><p><img src=./graphics/2024-10-03-factcheck-based-scoring/mockup-factcheck-based-scoring.png alt="mockup factcheck-based scoring UI"></p><h2 id=scoring-formula>Scoring formula:</h2><ul><li>So now the informed/uninformed opinion is based on the conditional tally (e.g 5% voting for Joe Biden <strong>given</strong> he dropped out) and unconditional or initial tally (45% voting for Joe Biden initially), and the accuracy estimate of the top sub-factcheck.</li><li>The effect of a sub-factcheck is the difference between the conditional and unconditional result.</li><li>The final/informed poll result is determined by adjusting the effect of the fact check by its accuracy estimate. In the above example, since the accuracy estimate is 99% then there is no adjustment (the final result is 5%). But say initially it was just a rumor that Biden dropped out, with accuracy estimate of 50%. Then the effect would be multiplied by 50%, and the score would be midway between 45% and 5%.</li></ul><h2 id=threads>Threads</h2><p>So any single fact check, even if true, may be misleading, so there needs to be the ability to respond to the top fact-check with the top counter-fact-check, etc.</p><h2 id=reasoning>Reasoning</h2><p>Some of the problems I am trying to solve with this modified approach.</p><ol><li>One, ambiguity in whether somebody &ldquo;considered&rdquo; something or not. Now, we explicitly ask users to consider things.</li><li>No counter-intuitive situations where downvoting something causes it to have more of an effect.</li><li>Distributed reasoning. Sub-fact-checks can be debated independently, and the results of factchecks deeper in the conversation tree &ldquo;bubble up&rdquo; automatically. For example, if it turns out it was just a rumor that biden dropped out, and the accuracy estimate for &ldquo;Biden dropped out of the race&rdquo; is 0%, then we don&rsquo;t need people to change their votes on the top-level poll &ndash; we can automatically adjust the result.</li></ol></div></article></main><footer class=footer><ul class=footer-links><li><a href type=application/rss+xml target=_blank>RSS</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/social-protocols>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://mas.to/@SocialProtocols>Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/@socialprotocols>Medium</a></li><li><a href=https://socialprotocols.substack.com>Substack</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/socialprotocols>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://social-protocols.zulipchat.com/join/3awvls77dbmolwlradnfmkig/>Zulip</a></li></ul></footer></div></body></html>
