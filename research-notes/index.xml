Then we are observing the following events:
$u_A := \text{the event that a vote on A is an upvote}$ $u_B := \text{analogous}$ $s_B := \text{the user was shown post B}$ $\bar{s_B} := \text{the user was not shown post B}$ $s_{B*} := \text{the user was shown the top note on B}$ $\bar{s_{B*}} := \text{the user was not shown the top note on B}$ Then we define two quantities:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-06-informed-probability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-06-informed-probability/</guid><description>Measuring Informed Probability Our scoring formula starts with an estimate of the probability that a user upvotes a post, and then observes how exposure to information in the note influences that probability.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-06-vote-tallies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-06-vote-tallies/</guid><description>Computing Vote Tallies The notes here have been updated and moved to 2024-05-24-calculating-tallies.md</description></item><item><title/><link>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-10-brigading-solution-matrix-factorization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-02-10-brigading-solution-matrix-factorization/</guid><description>Thoughts on &amp;ldquo;Brigading&amp;rdquo; The community notes algorithm, doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem of &amp;ldquo;brigading&amp;rdquo;, or the &amp;ldquo;self-selection problem.&amp;rdquo;

weight returns a score for determining the top comment for purposes of calculating the informed probability of the post. It is a measure of how much the critical thread that starts with that comment changes the probability of upvoting the post.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-07-19-notes-on-imbalance-score/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/research-notes/2024-07-19-notes-on-imbalance-score/</guid><description>Notes on 2024-07-19-thoughts-on-convincingness.md This note is a response to Johannes&amp;rsquo;s 2024-07-19-thoughts-on-convincingness.md
