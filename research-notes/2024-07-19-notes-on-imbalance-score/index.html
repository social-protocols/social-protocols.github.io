If upvotes on B and upvotes on A are perfectly correlated, the imbalance score will be 0, and if they are totally uncorrelated (statistically independent), the imbalance score will be maximized.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s simplify things by assuming that that we always have equally sized groups</p><p>$$
p_a = P(upvote A) = 0.5
$$</p><p>Since we are only interested in people who voted on A, let&rsquo;s slightly simplify our notation:</p><pre><code>- $`p   = P(upvote B)`$
- $`p_d = P(upvote B \vert downvote A)`$
- $`p_u = P(upvote B \vert upvote A)`$
- $`p_a = P(upvote A)`$
</code></pre><p>We can now write p as a function of $<code>p_d</code>$ and $<code>p_u</code>$:</p><p>By the law of total probability:</p><p>$$
P(upvote B) = P(upvote B \vert upvote A) \times P(upvote A) + P(upvote B \vert downvote A) ×P(downvote A)
$$</p><p>Which we can rewrite as:</p><p>$$
\begin{aligned}
p &= p_u × p_a + p_d × (1 - p_a) \
&= p_d + (p_u - p_d) \times p_a \
&= p_d + (p_u - p_d) \times 0.5
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p><strong>Aside</strong>: that note gives an example where $<code>p = 0.25</code>$, and $<code>p_d = .25</code>$, and says &ldquo;the further away from $p$ $p_u$ is&mldr;the higher the absolute imbalance&rdquo;. But $<code>p = p_d = .25</code>$ actually implies that $<code>p_u</code>$ is also equal to $<code>.25</code>$ &ndash; there can be no imbalance in this case.</p><p>Since $<code>p</code>$ is a function of $<code>p_u</code>$ and $<code>p_d</code>$, the &ldquo;imbalance&rdquo; formula is really just a measure of the difference between $<code>p_u</code>$ and $<code>p_d</code>$. Imbalance should be 0 when $<code>p_u = p_d</code>$, and should be maximized when $<code>p_u</code>$ and $<code>p_d</code>$ are very different (e.g. when $<code>p_u</code>$ = 0 and $<code>p_d</code>$ = 1 or vice versa). A simpler score, perhaps just $<code>abs(p_u - p_d)</code>$, would also have the properties we want.</p><p>But we could also just measure the statistical correlation of A and B. If $<code>P(upvote B) = P(upvote B \vert upvote A) = P(upvote B \vert not upvote A)</code>$ then by definition &ldquo;upvote B&rdquo; and &ldquo;upvote A&rdquo; are statistically independent.</p><p>The information-theoretic measure of statistical correlation is mutual information. In fact, I think if we really dug in, we&rsquo;d find your formula is closely related to the mutual information formula.</p><h2 id=micro-bridging-based-ranking>Micro Bridging-Based Ranking</h2><p>You are asserting that a high imbalance (low correlation between A and B) implies that B is likely to change users&rsquo; minds. But why would this be?</p><p>I think this implies something similar to a high &ldquo;common ground&rdquo; factor in a bridging-based ranking algorithm. In community notes, a note has a high score if it&rsquo;s upvotes cannot simply be explained or predicted by user&rsquo;s left-wing or right-wing bias.</p><p>When looking at a single post and a single comment/note, &ldquo;bias&rdquo; is implied by users&rsquo; votes on A. So we want to give a high score to replies to A that can&rsquo;t simply be explained by users&rsquo; biases (their original votes on A).</p><p>Of course, if people from both groups downvote B, then B probably isn&rsquo;t changing any minds. So what we want is not just lack of correlation, but a high upvote probability <em>despite</em> user&rsquo;s biases (just as in community notes, we want notes with a high <em>positive</em> common-ground factor, not just a non-zero common-ground factor). So we probably want to look at comments where $<code>p_u</code>$ and $<code>p_d</code>$ are both high.</p><p>Basically, we could do something that is kind of like bridging-based ranking but at a micro-level (single comment/note) instead of macro-level (all notes). The community notes algorithm effectively erases any difference between the sizes of the two groups. We could do the same by giving p_u and p_d equal weight (regardless of what p_a actually is). So the formula could be simply:</p><p>$$
(p_u + p_d) / 2
$$</p><h2 id=relation-to-existing-scoring-formulas>Relation to Existing Scoring Formulas</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t think such a formula could be used as a substitute for our informed probability measure or the effect measure based on informed/uninformed probability. It does not give us a way to score the post itself (just a way to score comments). And it would give the same score to two posts with a high common-ground factor, even if one is convincing and the other is not.</p><p>For example, consider the example of the video of an earthquake that turns out to be inauthentic. Suppose a comment with additional interesting information about the earthquake gets a high upvote probability for both groups (both those who upvoted and those who downvoted the video). But it does not effect people&rsquo;s votes on the video.</p><p>Suppose another comment explaining that the video was inauthentic also gets a high upvote probability for both groups. So both comments would have a high &ldquo;imbalance&rdquo; score, even though only one is actually providing new information that changes people&rsquo;s voting behavior.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><ul class=footer-links><li><a href type=application/rss+xml target=_blank>RSS</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/social-protocols>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://mas.to/@SocialProtocols>Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/@socialprotocols>Medium</a></li><li><a href=https://socialprotocols.substack.com>Substack</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/socialprotocols>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://social-protocols.zulipchat.com/join/3awvls77dbmolwlradnfmkig/>Zulip</a></li></ul></footer></div><script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js//highlight.min.js></script><script>hljs.configure({languages:[]}),hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script><script src=/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script></body></html>
