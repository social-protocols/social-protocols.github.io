      "contents": "\nHacker News is a social news aggregator provided by the US startup accelerator Y Combinator.\nOn Hacker News (HN), users submit stories (links to content anywhere on the Internet) that are then voted on by the community.\nThe main news aggregation happens on the top page of HN (or frontpage), where content is ranked according to the following formula:\n\\[\nscore = \\frac{(votes - 1)^{0.8}}{(age_{hours} + 2)^{1.8}} \\times penalties\n\\]\nWhile top is the most prominent page on HN, there are other pages as well.\nDetails on those pages can be viewed here.\nHacker News’ focus is not just on news, but the community has formed under a loose guideline.\nThe following is considered on-topic on Hacker News:\n\nAnything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one’s intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe user experience on HN is characterized by users browsing the different ranking lists.\nAt the same time, due to the above mentioned guideline, users have some idea about what might be interesting to the HN community, so they post new stories on HN when the stumble upon them elsewhere.\nLastly, each story has a discussion section with comment threads where users discuss the contents of the story posted.\nWhat differentiates HN from almost all other social computing platforms are, in our view, the following characteristics:\nThe rules of the social protocol are reasonably simple.\nThe amount of data created is manageable.\nIt works quite well and the community, overall, seems to be happy with it.\nThese characteristics make HN a perfect object of study when it comes to creating new ranking algorithms.\nOur interest in the topic started with an investigation into effects present in the current ranking scheme, where stories that are picked up by a positive feedback loop of attention and votes spiral upwards in the ranking while many “hidden gems” go unnoticed.\nIn order to test our ideas for new ranking algorithms that counter this feedback loop, we first tried to recreate HN as close as possible in a simulation that is still available for experimentation in the browser.\nWe soon realized that we need data to verify and benchmark how far off we were with our simulation.\nY Combinator provides access to a BigQuery database where all stories since the launch of Hacker News are available.\nThis database contains all the outcomes of Hacker News stories, but not how stories developed towards those outcomes.\nApart from that, Hacker News has an open API with end points to live views on all the the items (stories, comments, etc.) and users on the site.\nFurthermore, the ranking lists (top, new, best, etc.) can be obtained as lists of IDs.\nWe scraped this API for a period of over 4 months in 1 minute intervals to obtain a time series of almost everything that goes on on Hacker News for an extended period of time.\nThe scraper we used can be found and inspected on Github.\nWe started the data collection on 2021-11-23 23:10:07 and ended it on 2022-04-03 14:07:24.\nIn total, we tracked 110556 stories, of which 103961 were tracked over their entire lifecycle1.\nThe full dataset is stored in tsv format and compressed with 7z.\nIt is stored on the open science framework, the project URL is https://osf.io/bnysw/.\nYou can download it from there, for example like this:\n$ wget --no-verbose --show-progress https://osf.io/h9sjy/download -O hacker-news.7z\nfields:\nid: The item ID assigned by HN. Almost everything on HN is an item, e.g., stories, comments, jobs, … However, the dataset only contains stories as we only scraped the top lists.\nscore: This name is slightly misleading: score designate the raw vote count of the item, not the score obtained from the above mentioned formula. We left the name as is because the HN API delivers it with this name.\ndescendants: The number of comments (including comments of comments of comment…).\nsubmissionTime: A timestamp of the time the story was submitted in Unix epoch format.\nsampleTime: The time when the scraper collected the data point (also as a Unix epoch timestamp).\ntick: A running number of the sampleTimes.\ntopRank: The current rank on the top page (up to rank 90, otherwise \\N; this is true for all other collected ranks too).\nnewRank: The current rank on the new page.\nbestRank: The current rank on the best page.\naskRank: The current rank on the ask page.\nshowRank: The current rank on the show page.\njobRank: The current rank on the jobs page.\ngain: Votes gained since the last sampleTime.\nYou can view many of our analyses on this dataset on Github, but we would be happy to see what new insights you can draw from the data.\n(ADD SOME EXPLORATORY INSIGHTS/PLOTS ETC.)\n\non Hacker News, stories cannot be voted or commented on after a period of time↩︎\n",
